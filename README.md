# Lauterbach-Amen-Web-Scraper

This program is a webscraper program for scraping transaction descriptions on an IPA website for M&As of accounting firms. It flips through pages and loop-breaks into two levels of website to extract the needed information, then puts it inside a designated Excel form. There are also two other files used for financial data analysis and a website producer, which prints out websites of private equity transactions from the companies within the Excel.

This model is also used for many other personal webscrapers, such as those related to artificial intelligence, politics, and biomedical research. Because of their similarity, only this model is shown.
